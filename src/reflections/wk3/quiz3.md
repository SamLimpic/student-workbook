# Application Architecture, MVC Design Pattern

**1.** What are the Pillars of Object Oriented Programming (`OOP`)?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```

```
**2.** How would you access the `name` of the below object using the `property` variable?
```js
let staff = {
  name: "Tim",
  age: 26,
  job: "Code Monkey"
  }
let property = 'name'
```
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```staff[property]

```
**3.** What is Encapsulation?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```The storing of an object's properties privately, making them inaccessible to users.

```
**4.** What does the S stand for in the `SOLID` principles?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```Single Responsibility, the concept that any function should only be designed to run a single task

```
**5.** What the difference between a `class` and an instance of a `class`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```A "class" defines the properties of a reusable object, and any time an object of that "class" is created it is an instance of that "class"

```
**6.** What is a `Proxy` object?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```A stand-in object with properties that mimick its parent.  It can be used to modify an object's contents for functionality without actually modifying the parent object

```

**7.** What is the purpose of the `MVC` pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```To encapsulate and abstract the processes of a standard app.js file.  This can reduce code burden and assist in debugging your code.

```
**8.** What is the job of the `Controller` in the `MVC` Pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```The Controller handles direct-to-page functions such as "draws", handles "observers", and passes all more complicated functions to the service.

```

**9.** What is the job of the `Service` in `MVC`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```The Service handles complex functions, passed to them by the Controller

```
**10.** What is the job of the `Model` in `MVC`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```The Model stores and encapsulates your Class declarations.  They are referenced through the AppState, and Proxy Objects

```
