# Day 5 - End Week 1

## Daily Journal

Checkpoint 1!

I have always appreciated design; I had a brief stint in graphic design in my past college and work life, and it was nice to dive back into that headspace with a fresh lens.  Before this course I had never really designed a web page from the bottom up, and even though this challenge called for a duplicate rather than a true personal effort, I still appreciated the opportunity to flex some of those old design muscles.

I thoroughly enjoyed this checkpoint, and I feel it was an excellent application of the tools we have learned over the week.  I look forward to going over these checkpoints next week, and seeing what some of my peers were able to pull together!

### Weekly Reflections *(Optional)*

Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.
