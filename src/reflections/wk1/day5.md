# Day 5 - End Week 1

## Weekly Reflection

Checkpoint 1!

I have always appreciated design; I had a brief stint in graphic design in my past college and work life, and it was nice to dive back into that headspace with a fresh lens.  Before this course I had never really designed a web page from the bottom up, and even though this challenge called for a duplicate rather than a true personal effort, I still appreciated the opportunity to flex some of those old design muscles.

I thoroughly enjoyed this checkpoint, and I feel it was an excellent application of the tools we have learned over the week.  I look forward to going over these checkpoints next week, and seeing what some of my peers were able to pull together!
