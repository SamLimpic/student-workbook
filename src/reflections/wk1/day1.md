# Day 1 - Intro to CodeWorks

## Daily Journal

What I learned in Coding School is start low, go slow.

Today's lesson was a basic one: is everyone on the same page with the working philosophy of CodeWorks and does everyone have the minimum technical requirements to participate?

We covered CodeWork's Scrum project framework, and completed the necessary setup to push this blog to our personal GitHub page.  We also reviewed proper procedures for submitting Checkpoints to CodeWorks Academy, and uploaded the optional Moody Kittens project.

1. In your own words, why do we use Git?
        Git is a version control system that allows multiple developers to work on the same code, ensuring the entire team is using the same up-to-date version of then project.  It also allows the user to revert to older versions of a project in case of complications.

2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?
        Multiple branches allow users to run test comits of code separate from the Master branch.  This can fascilitate multiple developers tackling a problem from different angles, of which the ideal solution can later be merged with the Master branch.

3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub
        Git is a system that allows a developer to work on code in a local repository, and then push changes to a remote repository, like GitHub.  GitHub is a collection of remote repositories that can be downloaded to a local repository to allow individual developers to work with it.
