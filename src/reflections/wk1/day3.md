# Day 3 - Building with Bootstrap

## Daily Journal

Bootstrap!

I've heard tell of this mythical CSS tool ever since I started FreeCodeCamp back in Winter, but it has always been veiled in a thick fog of mystique...  And lo, the misty veil has parted and I can finally see Bootstrap in all its complicated, complicated glory.  And, to be honest, I find it not nearly so mystical as I was led to believe.  Complex, sure.  At times a bit obtuse, without a doubt.  But to be unveiled as nothing more than a set of pre-coded CSS classes was a bit underwhelming.  Not to say it isn't incredibly useful!  I plan on rewriting a few older projects of mine with Bootstrap in mind, since mobile accessibility has always been a sticking point of mine.  It's also clear that Bootstrap was designed with Flexbox at the forefront of its design philosophy.  With so many interweaving classes at risk of conflict with one another, Flexbox seems to provide the ideal way to avoid unnecessary complications in your design.  It'll certainly help me break my bad habits of "just change padding and margin until it looks good."

### Read Building Blocks Of Web Development > *Cheating At Design*

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?
    The idea of using Color and Weight to add emphasis to page elements, as opposed to size.  It's such a simple suggestion that not only simplifies your design workload, but also genuinely looks better on the page!

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.
    Google's unabashed simplicity is a good one to start, though I doubt I would take *all* their design philosophy to heart...  They tend to take it up to 11.
    I also appreciate GitHub's general aesthetic in their web design.  It feels like a good balance of simplicity and page density.  There's a lot of information on a GitHub page, but it's made to feel totally accessible by the user.  The Dark Theme is a nice touch too.
    I also discovered Unsplash yesterday, and I am a big fan.  I seem to have a thing for minimalistic design, and this site takes it as an artform.  With freeform photo layouts, their search results are engaging to simply scroll through, let alone select.  It reminds me a bit of Pinterest, but without all the social consequences of browsing it in public.

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
    Your design will draw the user to the elements that you want them to see.  It will ideally guide the user through all the various elements of your site, so that at a glance the user will have a good idea of what your site is designed for and how to get what they want out of it.  A perfect design would be able to guide the user through every site element as needed, which requires a good understanding of your ideal user experience.
