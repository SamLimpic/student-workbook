1. What is the purpose of wire-framing?
    Wire framing allows you to build a quick framework of a webpage without worrying about specific design mechanics in HTML or CSS.  It can then act as a reference while building your web page, and can even be used to apply specific styles and attributes that you implement into your wire frame.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
    Low-Fidenlity wire frames are basically web page storyboards.  They're a quick and dirty representation without any advanced styling that are best used to get a rough idea onto the page.
    Mid-Fidenlity wire frames are more fleshed out designs.  The layouts are more true-to-form, but they lack distracting page elements like images or typography.
