# Day 4 - Wire-Framing, Design Tool, and Review

## Daily Journal

I thoroughly enjoyed today's partner challenge.  It gave all of us a good opportunity to not only get to know our cohort a bit better, but also to assess our own skills relative to our peers.  It is helpful, I think, to have a realistic understanding if how your skills match up with others in your class, if only as a metric for areas that you require improvement upon.  The nice thing about working on this challenge in pairs is a direct line to somebody who may be more knowledgable in areas you feel you are deficient.  It also gives you a good idea of how forking GitHub repositories can be practically implemented in class, and allows you to familiarize yourself with an aspect of GitHub that will no doubt prove very useful in future!

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing?
    Wire framing allows you to build a quick framework of a webpage without worrying about specific design mechanics in HTML or CSS.  It can then act as a reference while building your web page, and can even be used to apply specific styles and attributes that you implement into your wire frame.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
    Low-Fidenlity wire frames are basically web page storyboards.  They're a quick and dirty representation without any advanced styling that are best used to get a rough idea onto the page.
    Mid-Fidenlity wire frames are more fleshed out designs.  The layouts are more true-to-form, but they lack distracting page elements like images or typography.
    High-Fidelity wire frames are basically unhosted web sites.  The layout should mimick exactly what you are looking to reproduce in HTML and CSS, and the page should feature working links to other mock pages.  These wire frames feature images and typographic elements that you are looking to duplicate in your page, and programs like Figma have utilities that allow you to identify the specific HTML and CSS effects you need to implement to do so.

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    I would say Low- to Mid- Fidelity wire frames are worth the effort, if only to help you flesh out your vision for how you want a site to look.  However, I personally would find it hard to justify the amount of effort put into drawing up a High-Fidelity wire frame.  Rather than mocking up the look I want to achieve and then mimicking it with HTML and CSS, I would rather work off a Mid-Fidelity frame and add the finishing touches to the web page itself.
