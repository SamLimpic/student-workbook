# Day 3 - CHECKPOINT

## Daily Journal

And shaped up well it did! By end of day today we'd met all our core functionality requirements, and Veronica and I are scheming on fun things to implement tomorrow!

Sweet Alerts are particularly interesting, and we'll have an opportunity to read up on HTML Drag and Drop before our Fireside tomorrow evening.

Today's workload went very smoothly, with us just busting out one element after the next until we had our entire skeleton built by Lunch. From there, it was all about filling in our components and before we knew it the whole thing was up and running like a charm!

### Read _Advancing with Vue 3 > Designing a Strong User Experience_

1. What is a User Experience? What should be considered when developing a User Experience?
   Every interaction your business has with people on your website
   Approach it like a potential customer, and consider what you would want out of the experience

2. What are some benefits of taking into account the User Experience?
   Improves user engagement and can make the job easier near the end of the project. If the user experience is optimized early, you don't have to worry about modifying core functionality down the road if expectations change

3. Why is the User Experience important?
   ...who do you think uses your website?
   If it's not enjoyable for the users, then nobody will.
