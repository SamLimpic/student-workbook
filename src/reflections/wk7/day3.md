### Read *Advancing with Vue 3 > Designing a Strong User Experience*

1. What is a User Experience? What should be considered when developing a User Experience?
Every interaction your business has with people on your website
Approach it like a potential customer, and consider what you would want out of the experience

2. What are some benefits of taking into account the User Experience?
Improves user engagement and can make the job easier near the end of the project.  If the user experience is optimized early, you don't have to worry about modifying core functionality down the road if expectations change

3. Why is the User Experience important?
...who do you think uses your website?
If it's not enjoyable for the users, then nobody will.
