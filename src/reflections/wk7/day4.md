# Day 4 - CHECKPOINT

## Daily Journal

Well... Functionality notwithstanding, this thing's looking... fine...

Hubris is, after all, my one great weakness...

Turns out, we were only testing functionality on one component at a time: one board, with one list, task, and comment.
And THAT worked just fine... the problems truly arose when we started building more in, something we thought would be a fun bit of improv.

And lo and behold, our entire app goes haywire! As it happens, you need to declare your arrays in your AppState as objects with unique IDs if you're going to render multiple iterations of them on the page at once... So that took the wind out of our sails a bit for most of the day.

Still, by day's end, we still had our finished product, now with the added benefit of ACTUALLY WORKING!

## Daily Challenges

Afternoon: Partner Checkpoint: https://github.com/SamLimpic/kanban

### Reflect on your Partner Project

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?
   Pair Programming goes hand in hand with proper documentation!
   While I lead our team planning, Veronica was on top of documentation, which lead to a great overall product!

2. What went well?
   We worked well together and communicated effectively. We had a good balance of skills that lent itself to a team project.

3. What would you do differently?
   I'd probably put a bit more forethought into the plotting of our project, to reduce redundant work that ultimately had to be redone when we reviewed our plan late in the project.
