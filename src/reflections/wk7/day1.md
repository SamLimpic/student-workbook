# Day 1 - CHECKPOINT INTRODUCTION

## Daily Journal

Say what you will about experimental projects, but I like being a guinea pig.  It seems kind of cool to be the first class to try a new checkpoint, even if it ends up being slightly more challenging than initially anticipated.

Even though I ended up hitting all the requirements, and some of them certainly took me longer than I had hoped, it does feel good coming out of it actually hitting 3 additional stretch goals on top of the base project!

Super down for Kanban, it sounds like a really engaging project!
I've been hearing the Seniors talk up Drag-and-Drop HTML for a while, and I'm interested in sinking my teeth into some new functionality.  I can think of plenty of reasons it could be a valuable tool for an engaging app design.
