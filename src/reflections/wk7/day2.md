1. What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?
A writeup, or key, to your code to make it easier to access for other developers
ReadMes, HowTos, or direct source documentation

2. What are some benefits of Code Documentation?
Clarifying vague variables or functions so any developer can more easily follow your line of logic in the code

3. How important is Code documentation and why?
Depends, do you want it legible to someone other than yourself?
If you're working with a team, do you want to slow down your process every time a developer looks over your code, or would you rather make your code easier to understand?
