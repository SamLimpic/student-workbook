# Day 2 - CHECKPOINT

## Daily Journal

Yup yup! Kanban is lots of fun!

Course, that assumes you don't... oh I don't know... forget a VERY important 'r' in one of your controller names and spend THREE HOURS hunting it down... Super productive Monday, I know...

Still, with that out of the way, this project is gearing up well. Our server side was completely handled by end of day today, so tomorrow is shaping up to make some solid progress on our front end!

## Daily Challenges

Morning:

Afternoon: Partner Checkpoint: https://github.com/SamLimpic/kanban

### Read _Advancing with Vue 3 > Code documentation for JavaScript with JSDoc: an introduction_

1. What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?
   A writeup, or key, to your code to make it easier to access for other developers
   ReadMes, HowTos, or direct source documentation

2. What are some benefits of Code Documentation?
   Clarifying vague variables or functions so any developer can more easily follow your line of logic in the code

3. How important is Code documentation and why?
   Depends, do you want it legible to someone other than yourself?
   If you're working with a team, do you want to slow down your process every time a developer looks over your code, or would you rather make your code easier to understand?
