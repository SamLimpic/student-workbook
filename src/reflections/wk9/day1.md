# Day 1 - CAPSTONE WEEK 2

## Daily Journal

Start of week 2, let's gooo!

We had an incredibly productive day today! We were able to has out our entire 'Quiz' function on a whiteboard this afternoon, and after coding it we were able to run our quiz from start to finish with no issues! That was a wonderful accomplishment, and it puts our MVP within easy reach!

We're really hoping to hit our MVP by tomorrow evening, which would leave us the rest of this week, Hack-A-Thon included, to flesh out our stretch goals and put out a fully-functional character by the end!

## Daily Challenges

Morning: Capstone

Afternoon: Capstone

### Reflect on your Capstone project thus far

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?
   Primarily utilizing node.js and a vue3 framework. We're focusing on mobile-first above everything else, since this app would best be served on someone's phone at a game table. We've needed to hard code a fair amount of information into our own servers, since the DnD API makes it unnecessarily difficult to access some of the more specific information. In some cases, the API lacks that information entirely!

2. What went well so far?
   We really nailed our core concept and MVP early on, which allowed us to make some significant headway on our back-end setup the previous week. By the end of Friday, our entire back-end was passing PostMan, and that allowed us to hard code a good chunk of data over the weekend to set ourselves up for this week.

3. What would you do differently? Why?
   I'd definitely approach our team dynamic differently from the outset. I have a lot of personal investment in this project, and I was not very open to sharing core responsibility with my teammates. That led to them feeling left out, and that was most definitely not what I intended. Hopefully I didn't foster any negative feelings on their part, since I do sincerely value what they've brought to the project. I realize that this project is more about establishing a solid team dynamic than delivering a perfectly polished product, and learning to drop my perfectionist attitude toward these things is definitely something I need to work on this week.
