# Day 4 - CAPSTONE WEEK 2

## Daily Journal

Home Stretch!!

Gotta backtrack now and hit some of the goals we discussed in our Code Review. Our quiz was a nightmare of contradictory and mislabelled functions, so today Gwen and I took it down and optimized it. We were able to elimenate hard-coded varianbles, and restructure the core functions to operate in a much more logical and cleanly-read manner (hopefully). That ended up taking most of the day, but we can now go back to that quiz and only modify a handful of variables to adapt the framework for any number of questions that we would need to add in future, as well as additional data sets that could be added to our server.

While we tackled that nightmare, Kevin and Veronica kept up with our page and component architecture, and we are most definitely on the home stretch of this App. With out MVP already hit, we're hoping to add some fun functionality tomorrow to really give this project the character that we want it to have.

1. What is an SSL certificate?
   A "Secure Sockets Layer" certificate is a way to establish an encrypted connection between a web server and browser.

2. What are the different types of certificates? What are they used for?
   Extended Validation: Most official and expensive, it is meant to ensure users your website is legitimate.
   Organization Validated: Medium encryption that validates to users that your organization and domain are real
   Domain Validation: Medium encryption that will ensure users that your domain is, indeed, yours
   Wildcard: Attached to a main domain certificate that allows you to register subdomains under the same name
   Unified Communications: Allows multiple domain names to be on the same certificate
   Single Domain: Protects a single domain with no subdomains

3. What are some benefits of using SSL certificates?
   It gives your users confidence that their information is secure while using your site. If users are expected to fill out sensitive personal or payment information on your site, many users would avoid your site altogether if it lacked that verification.
