# Day 3 - CAPSTONE WEEK 2

## Daily Journal

Day 3, and we're back at it!

After our group talk yesterday, we hit the ground running today and got a good chunk of our core functionality put together.

Kevin and Veronica focused primarily on Page and Component architecture, while Gwen and I took on targeted Gets and quiz results. The end result is tantalizingly close to a fully-functional app, just what we were hoping for! If not the prettiest by the end of Friday, all of us are hopeful that we'll be able to set up a pickup DnD game on Friday evening, using only our App to do it!

Might even be able to score a few hangers-on from the cohort while we're at it!

## Daily Challenges

Morning: Capstone

Afternoon: Capstone

### Read "Working In a Professional Environment > Scrum for Small Teams"

1. How are some ways Scrum for a small team would differ from Scrum with a large team?
   Since the workload will be split amongst fewer teammates, it is important to focus on active communication throughout the Sprint, and reduce extraneous meetings that would be otherwise necessary.

2. Why does Scrum prescribe to only run 1 sprint at a time.
   Since Scrum is based around adaptibility, the prioritization of 1 sprint at a time allows future sprints to change based upon progress made in previous sprints. In the event that future project goals change, prioritizing single sprints prevents redundant work from having to be redone to accomodate a new project goal.

3. What is the unattainable triangle and what purpose does it have in Scrum?
   _Good_ service _Cheap_ won't be _Fast_
   _Good_ service _Fast_ won't be _Cheap_
   _Fast_ service _Cheap_ won't be _Good_
   It is important to prioritize the area of your project that will require the most attention, as a means to mitigate this Triangle. Running parallel sprints or backtracking existing ones can only exaccerbate this potential problem.
