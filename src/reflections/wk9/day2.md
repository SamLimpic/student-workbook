# Day 2 - CAPSTONE WEEK 2

## Daily Journal

Week 2 seems to be going pretty well, all things considered...

We hit a bit of a snag for the first half of the day, since I didn't realize a targeted "Get" is an already baked in command in our project!
So a whole lotta time spent trying to do the thing that we could have done out of the box the week before... Which was a bit of a drag.

Still, managed to come together in the end! Our code review was a bit rocky, and it led us all to have a sitdown and sort out our priorities for this week, but I think that all of us feel much better about our progress as a whole.

We hit our MVP this afternoon, and are all stoked to spend the rest of the week trying to hit our stretch goals!

### Read "Working In a Professional Environment > Github Actions and How to Use Them"

1. What is a Github action and how do they work?
   An automated action that you can pre-program to run whenever a specific condition is met. Such as somebody pushing changes to a branched project.

2. What benefits do Github actions provide?
   They can streamline your workflow and automatically handle many actions that previously required multiple manual steps to accomplish.

3. What types of trigger actions can a workflow use? What do they do?
   Workflow Actions trigger when someone modifies the code in some way, like pushing changes to a branch.
   Scheduled Actions trigger on a regular basis, as a sort of automatic update.
   Webhook Actions trigger when an external source interacts with your repository.
