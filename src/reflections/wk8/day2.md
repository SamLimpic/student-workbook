# Day 2 - CAPSTONES

## Daily Journal

Day 2!
Our "Shark Tank" overview yesterday gave us a great overview of the holes in this project that we had not considered, and gave us a great perspective on how to best accomplish our MVP.

So that was today's move: Refine our roadmap to our MVP and hit the ground running!

We've established the mechanism that we will use to determine our recommendations, and we made sure to keep in mind that we want it to be expandable in the future. We've reconstructed what our MVP will truly consist of, and pushed any extraneous features to Stretch Goals. But that's not to say they won't be achievable, to date I've never finished a project without including at least a few of those!

Our new MVP is to create a "personality test" of sorts that suggests an idea character class for the user, with recommended races and backgrounds.

I certainly have aspirations to grow beyond that MVP, but it is a perfectly manageable starting point!

### Read "Working In a Professional Environment > Scrum for Small Teams"

1. Why is communication on a small team important?
   Good communication is the foundation of a working team dynamic. Without it, your project will be plagued by redundant meetings, duplicated efforts, and interpersonal conflicts.

2. What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?
   I like Zach's "Mini Waterfall" ideology. Make small benchmarks in order of necessity, as they become viable. This allows the end goal of the project to remain maleable, but also provides enough structure to consistently deliver the necessary steps to our MVP.

3. What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?
   _Good_ service _Cheap_ won't be _Fast_: Delivers a reliable product, but won't meet strict deadlines with 100% functionality.
   _Good_ service _Fast_ won't be _Cheap_: Strict adherence to deadlines and an uncompromising MVP will require more man hours to fit the timeframe.
   _Fast_ service _Cheap_ won't be _Good_: If you just want _something_ by the deadline, you'll have it. But it won't be the best.
