# Day 1 - CAPSTONE INTRODUCTION

## Daily Journal

I'm gonna cry!

I've had a silly scheme for Capstones since week 2 when we first began messing with APIs. I poured over the DnD API and realized just exactly what I could do with it, and lo did a silly scheme indeed begin to form!

Wouldn't it be nice if we could streamline the process of character creation in DnD? Admittedly, this is not a new concept, but I always found it difficult to wrangle someone fresh to the game through the process without it taking at least an hour or 2. And it makes sense why, there's a lot of info that you need to dump on someone before they'll have the necessary context to make a character of their own.

But... we only have to do that because everything you need to make a character is in a 300 page book. Often, when I help a new player with their character, I'll begin the process by asking a series of clarifying questions about _how_ they want to play the game, and use that to suggest a character that they might enjoy. To trim down the required reading to as manageable a chunk as is reasonable.

So... that. That's what we're doing. And I got 3 nerds to go along with it!

### Read "Working In a Professional Environment > An Honest Guide to Building a Powerful Developer Portfolio"

1. What function does a developer Portfolio provide?
   It increases visibility and accessibility to your previous body of work. It functions simultaneously as a library of your past experience and current skillset, as well as a stamp of your own personal programming "brand".

2. What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?
   Displaying a wide range of competently-coded applications. Each should stand on its own functionality, but a truly exceptional portfolio would also follow a general theme that is reflective of your own personal programming style.

3. What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?
   I'd probably include an improved version of my Moon Miner offshoot, rebuilt using Vue. It seems like an excellent example of reusable Vue components.
   I'd also include Kanban, as it is a solid demonstration of a working Full Stack.
   I'd most definitely include our Capstone, as we're going absolutely balls out on this one and I want to show off the most usable and useful application I'll have made to date. Not to mention that its place as a group project is a demonstration of my ability to function in a group.
