1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?
    Function Declaration: defines a named function
        function name(parameters) {}
    Function Expression defines a named or anonymous function
        let name = function(parameters) {}
    Arrow Function: a truncated syntax for writing Function Expressions

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?
    Parameters are used when defining a funciton; they are the names created in the function definition.
    Arguments are the values the function receives from each parameter when the function is executed.

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?
    Higher Order functions accept another function as a parameter or returns another function, such as "array.prototype.filter".
