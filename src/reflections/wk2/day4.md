# Day 4 - TIMEOUTS, INTERVALS, AND LOCAL STORAGE

## Daily Journal

Intervals have so much potential application in dynamic web design!  This is yet another moment where I feel like I need to rewrite entire sections of older projects to incorporate them.  There are games where an appropriately-placed interval can vastly improve the layout of a function, and reduce the amount of hard Javascript I would need to code in any web page.

### Read *Intro to JS > The Mistakes I Made as a Beginner Programmer*

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?
    A plan can help cut down on redundancies in your process.  There are innumerable ways to solve problems in your code, and if you have a plan from the get-go you can ensure that all of those solutions work together to cut down on unnecessary code.

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?
    Work backward through your problem to get a clear understanding of the intended process.  Step back piece by piece to identify existing problems, then move forward from that piece and continue until it works as intended.

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?
    Take your time, and think critically about the best pathway to achieve solutions to your problems.  Moving too quickly, or handling too many problems at once can, at best, produce overly-complicated code or, at worst, gridlock your code altogether with contradicting functions.
