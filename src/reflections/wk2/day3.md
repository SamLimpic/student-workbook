1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.
    Printing to the console with "console.log()" can help you verify if a function is working or a value is calculated properly.
    Printing errors to the console with "console.error('error message') can help you identify a particular error in your function, with a following link that will help you identify the area where the error is occurring.

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?
    Using the Debugging pane in the Sources tab, you can view your call stack and breakpoints.
