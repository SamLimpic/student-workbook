# Day 2

## Daily Journal

And here we are!

Took me most of the day, so it seemed a but rude to ask for a grading at 5pm. But still, I should be ready for my first grading tomorrow morning, and I'm aiming for 100% on this guy out of the gate.

Which means I have a good amount of time on my hands this week...

Once the grading's done, I can get rid of all those bs test posts and make a cohesive site. I'm thinking a Lord of the Rings social media site would be pretty good. And I'll probably keep going on this thing til I get tags working....

So maybe I have a good amount on my plate as it is anyway...
