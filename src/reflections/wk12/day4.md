# Day 4

## Daily Journal

Welp. That's that.

Projects as done as it can be, and any more fiddling would just be gilding at this point.

I think today is a Landing Page day. I got a fun idea built around basic af CSS to start, and then building it in real time with DOM manipulation and timeouts. Sounds like a real challenge, and I'm here for it.

Brittany cautioned against building a landing page yourself unless you're a real 'CSS Guru', and I took that as a personal challenge. We'll see how it fares over the weekend. Making the whole thing work in vanilla JS will be a real pain... but that just strikes me as a bit of extra fun all things considered.
