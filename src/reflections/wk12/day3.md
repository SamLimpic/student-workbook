# Day 3

## Daily Journal

Aaand passed!

Well, technically passing is a good start, but - of course - when showing the damn thing off I found a bug. And while said bug doesnt technically go against any of the requirements... I refuse to accept it! So about half of my day was spent hunting that damn thing down.

But it's solved all the same. And now we can move on to the fun stuff!

Project's named Fellowship, and I'm filling it up with all manner of Lord of the Rings goodies. Once I get tags working it'll be a real treat, and I'm gonna throw a bunch of easter eggs in there for the well-to-do.
