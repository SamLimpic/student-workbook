# Day 1

## Daily Journal

Are journals required on holidays?

It's a bit late in the game to ask at this point... so we'll just assume they are.

Progress is damn good on this thing. I knocked the Postman tests out before end of day on Friday, and so all this weekend was front-end. I must have spent about 3 hours on Saturday seelcting a color scheme, but that was more for me than for the project. Gotta love Colormind... I could spend an entire afternoon on that thing, just making color palettes.

Still, I managed to get actual work done this weekend as well. As of now, I'm pretty sure this thing is in a passing state, but that's never been the limit for my projects thus far. I'm going til I hit at least 100% before I call it on this one.
