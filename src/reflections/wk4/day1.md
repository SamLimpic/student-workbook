### Read *Asynchronous Code > Callback Hell*

1. What are some of the signs and causes of Callback Hell?
    -Bloated code that tries to do too much with a single function
    -Lack of modules that encapsulate aspects of your code to be referenced
    -Ignoring small errors, which build upon one another

2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?
    -"Happens in the future, not immediately"
    -Callbacks await a "signal" to fire a specific function only when it is needed

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix Callback Hell
    -Simplify your code
    -Implement models / modules to encapsulate your code
    -Fix every error, large or small
