Man, this course has been legitimately life changing. Without going into too much detail for whatever disgruntled TA happens to be reading this, I was in a bad way this time last year. Dead end job, long hours, and few professional prospects that even came close to appealing. On the recommendation of a friend, I took up coding in my off hours, dipping a toe in to see if it was worth my time. Very quickly, I'd filled up 2 notebooks with notes and found myself spending my work days longing for the off hours simply for the chance to dive further into my studies.

It was a nice feeling, and it had been a long time since I'd felt that way about anything academic. After 6 months, me and mine sat down and worked out a plan. It would involve pulling up stakes and caravaning 1000 miles away from our childhood home, leaving nearly everyone we'd ever known behind. It was a hard choice, but one we ultimately decided we couldn't pass by.

It's been a rough one the past few months. Leaning on family during tough times, sleeping on a mattress in our kitchen for a handful of weeks, slowly rebuilding the home that we'd ripped up by the roots in hopes of finding something better. And now that I'm here, it looks like that something better is within reach, and it seems to be everything that we'd hoped it would be.

The friendships I've made in my short time at Codeworks, and the mountain of knowledge I've had crammed into my skull, far exceeded any expectations I would have when I signed on for the program. I am incredibly grateful, both to the friend that put me on this path, and all the friends I've found in this small corner of Boise that helped me along the way. I can only hope that I'll be able to repay all the kindness that I've experienced in this short time, and put all the knowledge I've gained to good use.
