# Day 2 - INTRODUCTION TO DOTNET WEBAPI'S

## Daily Journal

Ok... ok...

Getting a bit more in depth today, lotta new syntax to work through.

Still, it's very helpful to have Node.js as a knowledge base to draw from when learning C#. It really makes the entire process so much simpler the 2nd time around.

A lot of the "grammar" for this language is similar to Node, it's just the vocabulary that changes out. We still utilize MVC, and all those components function very similarly to Node. Frankly, I can see why this program is able to work through this material as fast as it can, now that we're nearing the other end of it all and we can so easily grasp the basics of a fundamentally new language in just the first 2 days.

Admittedly, this could be my hubris talking... we'll see how Day 3 treats us...

### Read "Foundations of C# > C# List"

1. What is a List in C#?
   An indexible data collection. Because it is a generic type, it can be made up of any data type, including integers, strings, and even objects.

2. What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?
   AddRange, Insert, and ToArray all seem very useful! And in some ways they seem more straightforward than the standard Array Methods we would otherwise use in Javascript.

3. How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?
   Find or FindAll depending on if you were looking for the first instance of an item, or every instance.
