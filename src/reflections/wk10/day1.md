# Day 1 - INTRODUCTION TO C#

## Daily Journal

Okay... these text adventures are entirely too much fun!

I could spend an entire week delving into all the stupid stuff you can do through the Console, and I might just have to once this cohort wraps up!

It's retro and fun, and vscode makes it far too easy to do! Beeps and Boops aside, making an interacting "character" out of your computer is something I take entirely too much joy from.

That being said, I feel like today is giving me a false sense of security in how complex C# will end up being...

Like that's a surprise by now... I think I'll enjoy the fun days when I can!

### Read "Foundations of C# > C# Data Types"

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?
   Value: Holds a data value in its own memory
   Reference: References the address where the data is stored
   Pointer: Points to a data point, but that point cannot itself be a reference type

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?
   Bool, Char, Decimal, Int, Float, Enum, etc
   These data types are much more refined and deconstructed than standard Javascript value types. Doubtless this will allow them to apply more specifically.

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?
   The variable and its value are each assigned a random address in memory, and that address is called upon wheneber that data is required.
   Value types store their own data in their own memory, so no reference is needed.
