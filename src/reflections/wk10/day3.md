Afternoon:

### Read "Foundations of C# > C# Enum's"

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?
   Strongly-typed value types that allow you to assign symbolic names to specific values.
   You can assign Enums a mininum and maximum value, so if you needed a specific number of variables you could assign them enum values, effectively "x of y" or something like that.

2. How can you modify an Enum?
   Similarly to how you would modify the values contained within any object

3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)
   I certainly can tell you how I _could_ have used them! Mark mentioned that we could utilize enums in our Capstone, but we didn't quite have our heads wrapped around what that meant at the time. Admittedly, after this reading it makes quite a bit more sense.
