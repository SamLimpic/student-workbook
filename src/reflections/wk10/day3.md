# Day 3 - DOTNET WEBAPI'S SERVICE LAYER

## Daily Journal

Ugh... Back to the Firehose method I see...

At least by this point we're used to it...

Truthfully, the deluge of unfamiliar syntax was less overwhelming this time around, but I still found it problematic having to deal with the pile of minor typos and cascading error messages until around 4pm.

Still, I can see the utility of SQL once it stops being such a &$%\*@ to put together... Hopefully that day is closer than our Final...

### Read "Foundations of C# > C# Enum's"

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?
   Strongly-typed value types that allow you to assign symbolic names to specific values.
   You can assign Enums a mininum and maximum value, so if you needed a specific number of variables you could assign them enum values, effectively "x of y" or something like that.

2. How can you modify an Enum?
   Similarly to how you would modify the values contained within any object

3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)
   I certainly can tell you how I _could_ have used them! Mark mentioned that we could utilize enums in our Capstone, but we didn't quite have our heads wrapped around what that meant at the time. Admittedly, after this reading it makes quite a bit more sense.
