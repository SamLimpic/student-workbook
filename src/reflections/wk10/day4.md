# Day 4 - CONNECTING TO A MYSQL DATABASE

## Daily Journal

Honestly, I can't tell at this point if I prefer C# to Node.js

They seem fairly similar, when it comes to setting up the back end, and C# may have a slight edge in that its syntax is a bit more cookie-cutter, which allows you to construct a backend framework and reapply it to different elements much easier.

Course, Node is also fairly reproducable, but it seems that C# may have a slight edge on it in that respect.

Still, I feel like I won't have a great grasp of it until I get the opportunity to use it for a Full-Stack application to see how it integrates into Vue...

From the sound of it, this week's optional Checkpoint may very well give me that opportunity to test just that.

### Read "Dotnet WebAPI's > Welcome to SQL"

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?
   Information in a row details the specific instance of an object
   Information in a row defines the properties of each object

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called characters with the values name, age, description as strings, and an int id.
   |--NAME-|-AGE--|--DESC--|-ID-|
   | "Sam" | "29" | "Dope" | 42 |

3. What is the difference between the following statements:
   DELETE FROM table_name <-- Removes an item FROM a table
   DROP TABLE table_name <-- Remove the ENTIRE table
